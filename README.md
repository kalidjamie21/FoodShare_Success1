# FoodShare_Success1
A Digital Solution to Food Donation

FoodShare is an app built for Ethiopia. It allows users to notify an NGO about the
availability of excess food that can be donated to people in need. 
The NGO will receive relevant information about the food through email, and
designated drivers will pick up the food from the company's location and donate it accordingly. 

Users of the app can include individuals (households), restaurants of all kinds, event organizers, etc.
